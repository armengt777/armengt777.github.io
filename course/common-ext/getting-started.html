        This course is developed to be delivered in Cisco NetSpace.
        For the best experience, it is strongly recommended that the course materials, including labs, activities, and assessments be accessed directly from Cisco NetSpace.
      </p>
      <p> 
        For academies that have a need to deliver the course from a local server due to bandwidth limitations or local institution policies, a downloadable option is provided for Cisco Networking Academy instructors to install the course on a local server.
        The downloadable file is to be downloaded by instructors only and used for instruction purposes.
        It should not be made available or distributed directly to students, it should only be used for instruction purposes.
      </p>

        This course was designed for the Web and for best results; it is recommended that these files be viewed on a local web server.
        Viewing the course using the local <strong>file://</strong> protocol may not allow the Flash media to properly load its contents, since most browsers place security restrictions on this protocol.
        If you don’t already have a local web server, it is recommended that you download and install the <strong><a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache HTTP Server</a></strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are not able to use a local web server and the Flash media is not displaying properly, you will need to add the location of these files as a “Trusted Location” in your Adobe Flash Player settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        To update your Flash Player settings, simply right click on any graphic and click on “Global Settings” to update your Flash settings.
        NOTE: menu items and settings can vary by computer and operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        To specify a trusted location:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          On the <strong>Advanced</strong> panel, under <strong>Developer Tools</strong>, click <strong>Trusted Location Settings</strong> and then click <strong>Add</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enter the location or click <strong>Browse for folder</strong> to locate the folder on your computer where you extracted the ZIP file.
          Specifying a folder instead of a file makes all of its contents (including subfolders) become trusted as well.</li>
        <li>
          Click <strong>Confirm</strong> to add the folder to the list of trusted locations.
        </li>
      </ol>
